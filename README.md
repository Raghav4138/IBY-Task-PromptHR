## Candidate Evaluation Project

## Overview
This project aims to evaluate candidates based on emotion scores, transcript analysis, and speech speed to provide actionable insights for recruitment decisions.

## Project Structure
- **Data**: Contains the datasets used for analysis, including emotion data, gaze data, and transcript data.
- **Notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks for data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating insights.
- **Scripts**: Python scripts for specific functions and model implementations.

## Insights Generated
The project generates insights for each candidate, including:
- Recommendation to recruit or not.
- Reasons based on positive emotion scores and speech pacing.
- Average speech speed for each candidate.

## Plotting Graphs
To visualize data and insights, graphs are plotted using relevant parameters. **Note:** The parameters for plotting graphs may need to be changed based on your specific data and analysis requirements.

## Model Changes
The project allows for flexibility in model selection and implementation. You can modify the model used for analysis to explore different approaches or improve performance.
